% DC_MOTCORHELP MATLAB code for DC_motcorhelp.fig
%      DC_MOTCORHELP, by itself, creates a new DC_MOTCORHELP or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = DC_MOTCORHELP returns the handle to a new DC_MOTCORHELP or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      DC_MOTCORHELP('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in DC_MOTCORHELP.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      DC_MOTCORHELP('Property','Value',...) creates a new DC_MOTCORHELP or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before DC_motcorhelp_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to DC_motcorhelp_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".

Depending on the nature of your data and how you will analyze them later, it may be possible to remove these frames from your video manually in a program like ImageJ/Fiji.
