%Why, hello there! This script was written by Daniel Cantu originally to correlate whisker stimuli with fluorescent traces
%    obtained with 2-photon imaging of GCaMP6S in the mouse barrel cortex. This is a flexible script and should be adaptable to 
%    comparing stimuli with various types of recorded output signals.
%
%The general function of this script is to take a set of fluorescent signals and a single stimulus vector to which they were
%    all subjected. Then, for each individual trace, it compares the trace to the stimulus and attempts to find the delay time
%    between the stimulus and the recorded signal. The signal and stimulus traces are then aligned and the correlation between them
%    is found. Then, this is repeated a number of times set by the user using many randomly-scrambled sets of data (1000+, generally).
%    The correlation of the actual signal vs the array of scrambled signals are compared and the percentile rank of the actual
%    amongst the scrambled is found. It's pretty cool.
%
%-----------Inputs------------
%stimulus_trace is a column vector of the stimulus where 0 is no stimulus and 1 is a stimulus.
%signal_traces is a matrix of the traces of your signal, which can be dF/F, Z-scores, raw F, etc.
%    The format of this is that your individual traces are each in column vectors.
%maxlagframes is the maximum number of frames your signal can lag behind the stimulus. This should definitely not be greater than
%    the period between repeated presentations of a stimulus.
%scrambles is the number of scrambles to perform and compare. 1,000 is generally a good number, but 10,000 works if you have time to spare
%    and you happen to have a rather long signal and would, thus, like to try a large number of combinations.
%threshold_value is the value of which a trace must pass in order to be
%   considered significant (e.g. 3 for Z-score-based traces, 1 for stimulus trace).
%threshold_frames is the number of frames which a trace must pass in order
%   to be considered significant. (6 for GCaMP6 8hz, at least 1 for stimlus trace)
%before_frames is the number of frames to add before the initial passing of
%   threshold, in order to find the true start of the epoch (3 for GCaMP6 8hz, 0 for stimulus trace)
%after_frames is the number of frames to add after the final passing of threshold (8 for GCaMP6 8hz, 0 for stimulus trace)
%reference is where you select what is going to be used for scrambling. Enter 'signal' for scrambling the signal trace,
%    enter 'stim' for scrambling the stimulus trace. 
%
%-----------Outputs-----------
%signal_corr is the correlation (R) of your signals to the stimulus in a matrix.
%    These correlation numbers are bound to be low if you're comparing a square-pulse stimulus to long-tailed
%    traces such as those produces by GCaMPs. What matters more is the comparison to scrambled data.
%signal_delay are the delay times of your individual signals relative to the presentation of a stimulus in frames.
%    If you get a mix of positive and negative values, you can use the absolute value to determine the magnitude of
%    the delay. If presenting multiple stimuli that are spread apart, you should get a consistent sign in cells that
%    are considered to be actually responsive. If you are analyzing delays, don't forget to exclude cells that aren't
%    significantly correlated to the stimulus (relative to scrambles).
%signal_percentile is the percentile rankings of your signal traces relative to the scrambled traces.
%    Commonly accepted cut-offs for percentile are typically top 5% or 1% (0.05 or 0.01).
%    This is non-parametric and does not assume normality. Yay!
%    Since all traces are being compared internally to scrambled versions of themselves, differences in levels 
%    of fluorescent calcium indicator between ROIs don't impact results. Woohoo! :)
